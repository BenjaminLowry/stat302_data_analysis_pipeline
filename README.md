# stat302_data_analysis_pipeline

This repository contains part 2 of my final project for STAT 302 at UW. It contains a data analysis pipeline that analyzes data using random forest cross validation. See "Analysis/RFAnalysis.Rmd" for the analysis code and results. The directory "Output" also contains copies of the results that are regenerated whenever the analysis is re-run.
